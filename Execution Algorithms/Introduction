Financial researchers tried to find optimal distribution between aggressive and passive orders during the first ten years
since the change of millennium, as can be seen by timeline below:

1999-2003 - Starting from static trading strategies independent of price changes
2003-2007 - Continuous time trading with incorporation of impact functions
2007-2011 - Dynamic trading strategies based on fixed time price update
2011-2013 – Dynamic trading strategies based on continuous price update
2013-2015 – Application of dynamic programming to optimize strategy incorporating LaGrange multiplier and Poisson Process to
find solution 

Recently there has been a greater amount of research on optimizing execution within passive trading. Passive trading is also
of importance for market making strategies, as revenue of market makers is dependent upon capturing spread, while maintaining
minimum one sided position. This greater limelight on passive trading has led researchers to focus on limit order book, as can
be seen by the timeline below: 

1981 - First academic paper that explored modelling of non-execution risk. However, it was not until 2008 that 
another academic paper was written on non-execution risk.
2008 - Statistical properties of liquidity of limit order book analysed to formulate objective function of maximizing
investor’s utility.
2012 - Portfolio liquidation framework based on objective to maximize expected revenue of sales.
2013 - Solution designed for HFT firms maximizing terminal wealth while penalising inventory deviations from zero and 
terminal inventory holdings.
2015 - Price dependent liquidation strategy maximizing investor’s utility
2015 - Application of reinforcement learning to optimize market making in limit order book
2016 - Optimizing liquidation of child limit orders using short term momentum indicators
